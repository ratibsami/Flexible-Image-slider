**Flexible Image Slider Project**

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a flexible and customizable image slider component for websites. Image sliders are a common feature in web design, allowing users to showcase multiple images or content in a dynamic and engaging manner. However, many existing slider solutions are either too rigid in their design or lack sufficient customization options.

## Features
- **Flexibility:** Our image slider is highly flexible, allowing developers to easily integrate it into various types of websites and adapt it to different design requirements.
- **Customization:** We provide a wide range of customization options, including slide transitions, navigation controls, autoplay settings, and more, enabling developers to tailor the slider's appearance and behavior to suit their needs.
- **Responsive Design:** The slider is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessibility:** We prioritize accessibility standards, ensuring that the slider is usable by all visitors, including those using assistive technologies.
- **Lightweight:** The slider is lightweight and optimized for performance, minimizing loading times and resource usage.

## Usage
To use the image slider in your project, simply include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files, and add the HTML markup for the slider container and slides. You can then customize the slider's appearance and behavior using the provided configuration options.

## Configuration Options
- **Transition Type:** Specify the type of transition between slides (e.g., fade, slide).
- **Autoplay:** Enable/disable autoplay and set the autoplay interval.
- **Navigation Controls:** Choose whether to display navigation arrows/dots for manual navigation.
- **Looping:** Determine whether the slider should loop continuously or stop at the last slide.
- **Transition Speed:** Adjust the speed of slide transitions.
- **Custom Events:** Hook into custom events for additional functionality.
